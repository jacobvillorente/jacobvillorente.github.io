# jacobvillorente.github.io

an archive of my old wesbite, formerly jacobvillorente.com

i didn't really have a lot of html or css experience when i made my first landing page, so i relied on an app called nicepage. while it was great for some things, it didn't have a lot of the custoization features that i needed to use. plus, if you look at the file nicepage.css, it looks like someone out every single css property into one file and called it a day.

one intro to web programming class and a few free days in summer of 2022 later, i created my own website using html and css, and can be found at [jgv.cx](https://jgv.cx). 

i keeo this github repo incase there's some thing that i want to refer to later on. web programming has always been a hobby of mine, and through this new website, i'm able to expand on this hobby so much more than i used to be able to.
